Q - When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Ans - We would use a remote repository in cases where we need to collaborate with other people or open our source code for opensource collaboration. 
Multiple remote commits would be made to a single repository in case where we are collaborating on developing our product with other people.
Another advantage of remote repositories is that one can clone them on any device and resume the work where they left off (This would ofcourse be in 
the case that we have a private account)
