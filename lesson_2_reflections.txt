Q - What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Ans - All Git repositories are like windows directories. The only difference is that they are supposed
to contain metadata about the history of commits done in that particular repository. This metadata
is mostly kept in a hidden folder inside the repository called .git. Once we initialize the repository
it is in a head state, no commits have been made to it and it is not tracking the files inside the repository
untill and unless we use the git add command to add the file to it. Git reset can be used to remove
an already added file whereas git status tells us the status of tracked and untracked files

Q - How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Ans - The working directory is the directory which contains the files, these files are not a part of the repository
as of yet. We can use the add command to add these files to the staging area and then commit them to the repo.
The staging area serves as an intermediary where through git status we can check that all files to be
committed do indeed reflect a logical change.
